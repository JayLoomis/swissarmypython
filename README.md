# swissarmypython #
A collection of small tools, written in Python. Not designed to be general purpose, or even all that reusable, but useful as reference for the language if nothing else.

Each tool has its own folder, and should have its own readme inside.

Here's a master list:

| Tool | Description |
| ---- | ------------|
| dirfixer.py | Given a starting directory, walks the subdirectories and fixes problematic directory names. |
